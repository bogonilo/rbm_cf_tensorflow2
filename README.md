## RBM for Collaborative Filtering with Tensorflow 2
Implementation of Collaborative Filtering algorithm with RBM and Tensorflow 2.

This implementation is based on the one found in cognitiveclass.ai, https://cognitiveclass.ai/courses/deep-learning-tensorflow ML0120ENv2, 
Deep Learning with Tensorflow, in the lab of the section Restricted Boltzmann Machines: COLLABORATIVE FILTERING WITH RBM.

I am learning Tensorflow 2 and I decided to "translate" the lab of that section, implemented with the first version, to the second version. 
It doesn't use anything particular of tf 2, it just takes advantage of Eager Execution instead of using Graphs and Session.
