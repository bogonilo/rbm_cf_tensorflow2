# rbm_cf_tensorflow2
Implementation of Collaborative Filtering algorithm with RBM and Tensorflow 2

This implementation is based on the one found in cognitiveclass.ai, ML0120ENv2, Deep Learning with Tensorflow, in the lab of the section Restricted Boltzmann Machines: COLLABORATIVE FILTERING WITH RBM

I am learning Tensorflow 2 and I decided to "translate" the lab of that section, implemented with the first version, to the second version. It doesn't use anything particular, I just take advantage of Eager Execution instead of using Graphs and Session.
